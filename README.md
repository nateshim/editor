# editor

Text editor that supports the following features: 
- Cursor: The current position of the cursor should be marked with a flashing vertical line
- Text input: Each time the user types a letter on the keyboard, that letter should appear on the screen after the current cursor position, and the cursor should advance to be after the last letter that was typed.
- Word wrapping: Your text editor should break text into lines such that it fits the width of the text editor window without requiring the user to scroll horizontally. When possible, your editor should break lines between words rather than within words. Lines should only be broken in the middle of a word when the word does not fit on its own line.
- Newlines: When the user presses the Enter or Return key, your text editor should advance the cursor to the beginning of the next line.
- Backspace: Pressing the backspace key should cause the character before the current cursor position to be deleted.
